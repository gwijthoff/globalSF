To better attune your attention to the first of our longer novels, experiment with the Pomodoro Technique in your reading for this week. Ideally, you will use a simple kitchen or mechanical timer, paper, and a pencil. Other suggested timers are listed below.

1. Set your phone on airplane mode and turn off your laptop's Wi-Fi.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3. Read.
4. End reading when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break to check your phone (5 minutes), then return to step 2.
6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15â€“30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
