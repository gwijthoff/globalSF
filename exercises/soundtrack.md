This time, read while wearing headphones playing music that either a) you know very well---an album you've listened to hundreds of times---or b) music that is very minimalist. Options include a recording of Bach's [*Goldberg Variations,*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah392lnFHxM) Reich's [*Music for 18 Musicians,*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Pml8EX62M) Terry Riley's [*In C,*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRaa34E8tXQ) or Bryce Dessner's [*Music for Wood and Strings.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psqszrIxyiY&list=PLBuaVZPxXm3_XqEzUFcXjuNaFfrUn7Dwk) (Disclaimer: these happen to work well for me when reading/writing, but everyone has to find their own sweet spot.)

Each time you read this week, let that same piece of music be your soundtrack, and let it be the background of your attention to the text.
